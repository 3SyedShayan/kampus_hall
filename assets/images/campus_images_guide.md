# University Campus Images

## Image Specifications

### Diagonal Clipping Effect
The campus images are displayed with a diagonal clipping effect that creates a modern, dynamic look. The diagonal cut goes from the bottom-left area upward to the right, matching the design shown in the reference image.

### Required Images:
1. **nust_campus.png** - NUST University (for @nust.edu.pk emails)
2. **fast_campus.png** - FAST University (for @fast.edu.pk emails)  
3. **generic_campus.png** - Default university building

### Image Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Recommended Size**: 800x600px minimum
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:3 or 16:10 works well with diagonal clipping
- **Content Positioning**: Keep important visual elements (like the main building) in the center-upper area to ensure they remain visible after diagonal clipping

### Visual Style:
- Modern university buildings with glass facades work best
- Clear sky backgrounds enhance the diagonal effect
- Red/orange accent colors on buildings complement the app's cyan theme
- The reference image shows a multi-story building with a central glass tower - this style works perfectly

### Technical Notes:
The diagonal clipper creates a path that:
- Starts at full width at the top
- Gradually narrows toward the bottom
- Creates a dynamic perspective effect
- Allows the circular logo to overlay naturally in the center area
